- in follower when RequestVote is received at the moment this RequestVote is just processed but i think follower needs to convert to candidate (at least if it responds with a false) so it
  can be elected too. update: there is something about not reacting to RequestVote in "Cluster membership changes" section. update: on the other hand maybe no need to convert to candidate
  because follower will vote and new leader can be elected, but if it won't be elected this follower need to somehow become a candidate (and now RequestVote refresh follower timeout,
  maybe it shouldn't)
- "If a follower or candidate crashes, then future RequestVote and AppendEntries RPCs sent to it will fail. Raft handles these failures by retrying indefinitely" - but currently RequestVote is
  sent once for each server (maybe some sending actor with acknowledgement and resending needed, maybe without additional actor). update: on the other hand the election doesn't last long 
  (re-election after some time) so maybe no need to resend RequestVote, but for AppendEntries it's needed
- at the moment on receiving RequestVote in leader convertToFollower happens, why? (i don't remember). maybe convert to candidate or checking terms and staying leader should happen
- resending RequestVoteResponse (to guarantee message delivery)? see https://colin-scott.github.io/blog/2015/10/07/fuzzing-raft-for-fun-and-profit/#disqus_thread (raft-45: Candidates accept 
  duplicate votes from the same election term.) - there is a bug due to resending. update: again, due to reelection after timeout maybe resending is not needed
